# TTGO_LORA32_V1_w_SD_Card
Making the TTGO LoRa32 V1.0 board play nice with an attached SD card module.

I want to do a Range test LILYGO TTGO T-Impulse GPS and LoRa Wristband. It would be super handy to have a LoRa receiver paired with a SD or TF card to log the received data. I have a bunch of these TTGO LORA32 V1 boards. Let's use the TTGO LORA32 V1 with an SD card module to log LoRa packets from our LoRa transmitter.
